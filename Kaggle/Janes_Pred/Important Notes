# Note 1:
I have been using utility score as an extra metric other than BCE loss, accuracy and ROC AUC score in my private notebooks. 
I've found that these metrics are highly correlated. So, using one of them should be fine.

I think a better CV split strategy is more important than a metric.

# Note 2:
Very nice observation. :-) This is precisely why I asked for some clarification on if resp is a raw return or a residual aka under/over the market return. Most quant models predict the residual or at least are run long and short which has a similar effect.
When the target returns have a market component it become almost random. Market drift is not predictable; cross sectional under or outperformance is.

In the Kaggle M5 competition there was this same problem. ### The drift. 
In the entire training set Walmart sales never went down in June. People were employing “magic multipliers” on the forecasts to bias them upwards slightly. 
Great CV and public leaderboard performance. What happened? In the private leaderboard, sales went down.
A multiplier of less than 1 applied in any of a number of public kernels would have placed 1st. 1st!
